## What was my motivation?
To use all my newly developed React skills to set you apart from other developers whose portfolios donâ€™t use the latest technologies.

## What did I do?
Design a polished mobile-first design so that the site doesn't just look like the default Bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

## What did I learn?
- The importance of choosing a good colour scheme to help create something that will stand out.
- How to best utilise props and usestate functionality. 
- How to best combine bootsrap with custom css.
- Best practice for deploying a REACT app on Github Pages.
